# Cryptocurrency Analysis

## Overview

Using unsurpervised machine learning to cluster differnet cryptocurrencies by market value. 

The goals for this project are to:

* Prepare the data for dimensions reduction with PCA and clustering using K-means.
* Reduce data dimensions using PCA algorithms from sklearn.
* Predict clusters using cryptocurrencies data using the K-means algorithm form sklearn.
* Create some plots and data tables to present your results.
